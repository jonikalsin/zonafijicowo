The USC Trojans freshman, who has a NIL value of $212,000, is represented by Klutch Sports Group.</strong></p><p>At the age of 18, JuJu Watkins has already made a name for himself. Watkins of Sierra Canyon won the Gatorade National Girls Basketball Player of the Year title. JuJu averaged 27.5 points, 13.7 rebounds, 3.6 assists, 2.5 steals, and 1.7 blocks per game in her senior year at Sierra Canyon.</p><p>Watkins’ fame hasn’t diminished either when he joined the Trojans. JuJu, the top recruit in the class of 2023, was recently highlighted on SLAM magazine’s cover. With 31 points and seven rebounds against the Arizona State Sun Devils, she put on yet another outstanding performance.</p><h2>JuJu Watkins Net Worth 2024</h2><p>It is estimated that JuJu Watkins has a net worth of $600k to $800k. The USC Trojans guard’s NIL value, according to On3, is $212,000. In 2022, Watkins signed a big deal with Nike, alongside D.J. Wagner, Haley Jones, Bronny James, and Caitlin Clark. “To serve the future of athletes and sport, Nike is partnering with inspiring young athletes who are leading the way now — both on the court and in their communities,” the company said in a statement following the signing of the future superstars.</p><p>As we support them in achieving their goals, they encourage us to have even bigger dreams about the impact we can have together. JuJu was seen supporting several businesses before signing with Nike, including THE MELODY EHSANI SHOP. To promote her partnership with the apparel business, she dropped a video.</p><p>Hollywood celebrities including Chris Brown, Teyana Taylor, Miguel, and basketball players James Harden, Russell Westbrook, and Tina Thompson sent her short video tributes for her 17th birthday in 2022.
