Below is an overview of Mayo's career, including his rise in the NBA, the issues that led to his ban, and his current status.</p><h2 class=first:mt-0 data-mce-fragment=1 level=2>Promising Start and Early Career</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>OJ Mayo began his basketball journey by playing college basketball at the University of Southern California (USC). Following his college career, he declared for the 2008 NBA draft and was selected as the third overall pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves. Mayo's early years in the NBA were marked by high-level scoring, making significant contributions to the teams he played for, particularly the Memphis Grizzlies.</p><h2 class=first:mt-0 data-mce-fragment=1 level=2>Setbacks and Bans</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Mayo's career took a turn when he faced off-the-court issues, including a suspension in 2011 for testing positive for a banned substance, which he attributed to an over-the-counter supplement. This suspension was followed by a ban from the NBA for failing the anti-drug program. Despite applying for reinstatement in 2016 and getting approved, Mayo did not find a team willing to take a chance on him. Subsequently, his eligibility for reinstatement in the NBA ended without any team signing him, effectively ending his career in the United States.</p><h2 class=first:mt-0 data-mce-fragment=1 level=2>Legacy and Current Status</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Unfortunately, Mayo's legacy in the NBA has been overshadowed by the longest suspension in league history. Despite the setbacks, Mayo, now 33 years old, found an opportunity to continue his basketball career in the Chinese Basketball Association, playing for the Liaoning Flying Leopards.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>OJ Mayo's journey in the NBA started with promise, but it was marred by off-the-court issues that led to his ban from the league. Although his NBA career faced an abrupt end, he found a new opportunity to continue playing in the Chinese Basketball Association. Mayo's story serves as a reminder of the challenges and consequences that professional athletes can face both on and off the court.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>One could explore Mayo's impact on the teams he played for, the reactions from the NBA community regarding his bans, and the implications of his career trajectory for young athletes in professional sports.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0milm5lfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSool2irrq7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./josh-gad-share-tha-sarrow-of-losing-his-nephew-marco.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Josh Gad Share Tha Sarrow Of Losing His Nephew Marco</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./frank-clark-parents.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Frank Clark Parents, Ethnicity, Nationality, Religion, Age, Height, Weight, Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eliza-butterworth-biography.html>Eliza Butterworth Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-mcclendon-mac-t-shirt.html>Chris McClendon MAC T-Shirt | Fan Arch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./franck-ribery.html>Franck Ribery Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-j-fox-wont-live-80-parkinsons-disease-video.html>Michael J.
