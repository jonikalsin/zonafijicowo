Robert applied to Westminster Kingsway College of Culinary Arts while scrubbing pots and making sandwiches in a local gastropub, and went on to study and work at a variety of South London pubs and clubs.</p><p>Robert soon learned the gritty side of the industry when he bagged a job at Marco Pierre White’s Soho restaurant L’Escargot. After leaving, Robert went on to the bar where he was assistant manager. “At college, I was burning out and doing a bit too much and I needed an understanding of front of house”.</p><p>Learn more about him below in this bio.
