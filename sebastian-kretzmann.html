Sebastian Kretzmann became a popular TikTok creator through their attention-grabbing style and artistically-minded lip-sync performances.</span></h3><h2><span id=Early_Life>Early Life</span></h2><p>Sebastian Kretzmann first opened his eyes on <strong>August 11, 1997</strong>. She is <strong>26 years old</strong>. He denotes himself as ‘They’ as being queer. Moreover, he is from New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, and has American citizenship. Their father’s name is Shane Kretzmann. He is a movie actor and he also works as their agent.

Further, they posted a photo with one of their childhood heroes, Brendon Urie from Panic! At the Disco.</p><h2><span id=Controversy>Controversy</span></h2><p>They were a member of content creators Strawberry Milk Gang. Kretzmann was accused of making offensive racial slurs and sending inappropriate and sexually explicit messages to underage fans. According to RadicalSeb’s video, they were just hanging out with friends in a group chat and on a video call when they made explicit “jokes” to an underage boy.</p><p>He admitted that they knew that one of the boys in the video chat was underage, but they continued to make sexual comments because they were trying to be funny. RadicalSeb apologized for the offense caused in a video posted on TikTok. However, he denied asking anyone in the group to send sexual photos. They also did not address any of the racislanguagees he used.</p><p>RadicalSeb, which had 330,000 TikTok followers, was best known for its sketches and queer-focused content. They had a huge TikTok fanbase, their line of branded merch and there were even rumors of a tour with other members of Strawberry Milk Gang.</p><p>Moreover, the allegations against RadicalSeb blew up on TikTok and soon memes and responses to his apology were being created. But, the one that has caught on is a meme created with the video app’s duets feature, which allows videos to appear on split-screen.</p><p>However, he appears to have deleted his TikTok account private and disabled comments on his Instagram posts. Meantime, the other members of the Strawberry Milk Gang have condemned RadicalSeb’s actions and haven’t collaborated with them since.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-59788 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Sebastian-Kretzmann-controversy.jpg alt="Sebastian Kretzmann" width=650 height=544 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-59788 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Sebastian Kretzmann’s TikTok video became viral.
