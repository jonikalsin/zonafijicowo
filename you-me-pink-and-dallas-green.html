The lyrics express the depth of the singer's love, as well as the disappointment and heartache that comes when that love is not fully reciprocated.</p><br><p>The first verse establishes the amount of love the singer has given to their partner. She has given all that she has, and the partner has taken it without giving in return. The chorus emphasizes that this love is not just any ordinary love, and it is clear that the singer feels that this love is something special and worth fighting for.</p><br><p>The second verse begins with the singer crying and trying to hold on to this intense love. She recalls the moments when her partner's presence in her life brought daily joy and light. The chorus repeats the message that this is not just any love, it is extraordinary, and the singer is pleading with her partner not to let it go.</p><br><p>Overall, the song is a melancholic declaration of love and heartbreak. While the partner's response is not explicitly stated in the lyrics, it is clear that they are not reciprocating the same level of commitment, leaving the singer feeling alone and searching for something more.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>I gave you all the love I've got</u><br>I have given you all the love that I am capable of giving.</p><br><p><u>I gave you more than I could give</u><br>I have given you even more love than what I could give.</p><br><p><u>I gave you love</u><br>I have given you my love.</p><br><p><u>I gave you all that I had inside</u><br>I have given you all the love that I had within me.</p><br><p><u>and you took my love</u><br>You have accepted and taken my love.</p><br><p><u>you took my love</u><br>You have accepted and taken my love.</p><br><p><u>Didn't I tell you what I believe</u><br>Did I not express to you my beliefs and feelings?</p><br><p><u>Did somebody say that a a love like that won't last, didn't I give you all that I got to give baby</u><br>Despite someone saying that our type of love would not last, did I not still give you all that I could to express my feelings?</p><br><p><u>I keep cryin' for you</u><br>I'm still crying for you.</p><br><p><u>I keep tryin' for you</u><br>I keep trying to be with you and make things work.</p><br><p><u>There's nothing like you and I baby</u><br>There's no other relationship quite like ours, my love.</p><br><p><u>When you came my way you, brightened every day Umm with your sweet smile With your sweet smile</u><br>When you entered my life, you brought joy into each day with your kind and loving nature.</p><br><p><u>This is no ordinary love it's no ordinary love</u><br>This love is not typical or mundane, it is unique and special.</p><br><p><u>This is no ordinary love no ordinary love</u><br>This love is far from ordinary.</p><br><p><u>This is no ordinary love it's no ordinary love</u><br>This love is not typical or mundane, it is unique and special.</p><br><p><u>This is no ordinary love, no ordinary love</u><br>This love is far from ordinary.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC<br>Written by: HELEN ADU, HELEN FOLASADE ADU, STUART MATTHEWMAN</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maJGfqqyOsb5hh6Kmm5Sur7C%2BfZilpJGorIi%2BxJ6lYmd%2BpKyQvsOipZqqqZSZsMLE</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bryan-cranston-movies-ranked.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10 Best Bryan Cranston Movies, Ranked</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ex-girlfriend-of-blake-bortles.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ex-girlfriend of Blake Bortles Fresher Post</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eliza-butterworth-biography.html>Eliza Butterworth Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-mcclendon-mac-t-shirt.html>Chris McClendon MAC T-Shirt | Fan Arch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./franck-ribery.html>Franck Ribery Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-j-fox-wont-live-80-parkinsons-disease-video.html>Michael J.
