The controversial <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTuber</a> was permanently banned from YouTube in 2020. This came after he violated the platform’s harassment policies, and soon even Twitch followed YouTube’s footsteps, and his account on Twitch was removed too!</p><p>During his time on YouTube, however, he was at the pinnacle of controversy. Accused of many things, like using racial slurs and threatening people, his name was heavily linked to Pokimane’s rumored Twitch power. This was evident to many, as in one incident, Leafy got banned the day <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokimane</a> returned from her break.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Fast forward to 2023, and the YouTuber finally revealed his face after a long time by posting back-to-back selfies in the month of August. Creating a wave of attention around him, he has unfortunately turned himself into a victim of bullying, or so fans call it, as numerous memes are being made of him.&nbsp;</p><p>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Top 10 most followed streamers and YouTubers on Twitter’s rival, Threads</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-leafyishere-announces-he-will-be-going-to-the-gym-after-all-the-memes-made-of-him><span class=ez-toc-section id=LeafyIsHere_announces_he_will_be_going_to_the_gym_after_all_the_memes_made_of_him></span>LeafyIsHere announces he will be going to the gym after all the memes made of him<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Leafy.jpg><p>On August 3rd, 2023, LeafyIsHere finally arose from his hibernation. He posted a selfie on both Instagram and Twitter. Following this, he would post even more selfies in the coming three days. One of the pictures was captioned, “I’m not fat lmfao but yes shit got wild after 4 bans ahahahaha I’m on plane rn” Another picture was captioned, “leafy reveals his face for the second time in 2023.” This one gained over 12,000 likes in a day.</p><p>The immediate reactions spiraled on the internet, as fans were shocked to see LeafyIsHere’s appearance change. Many used this opportunity to troll the streamer, as he was familiar with controversy regardless. Even popular figures like Keemstar and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ricegum </a>reacted to his ‘face reveal’. Ricegum said, “You know how much food you got to eat to get like this.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>In response to all the comedic reactions online, LeafyIsHere has now announced he will be going to the gym. He took to Twitter and tweeted “Okay going to gym”. He even reacted to the memes that Keemstar on DramaAlert’s Twitter account had posted, saying “Bullying works”. To that, Leafy responded, “Nah I’m just taking more pills and less food”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-internet-did-not-disappoint-with-memes><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_internet_did_not_disappoint_with_memes></span>The internet did not disappoint with memes <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>What happened to leafy he went from victim to assaulter real fast</p>— Sniper (@sniperdagoat12) <a href=#>August 12, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Out of everything that could go viral, this sprung out of the box. Many speculate it was a publicity stunt, as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LeafyIsHere</a> seems to be taking it lightly as he seems to be laughing about it online. However, the weight gain is definitely real, as Leafy confirms he will be hitting the gym. However, bullying someone for his physical appearance is completely wrong and should not be supported at all.&nbsp;</p><p>In case you missed it:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57xKynqKqkqHqvsdasZJutnKHGqrrGZq6oqpuoeqW7zJqgp5dmYsK0sdGsZJutnKG2prCMnKanrJWjwW6v0Z6YraeiYrmmrcWyoKyglaeybsDOZp6oZaSkerW0xGaesqVdm7ytuM6woKefXZ22tHnRnpqepqRis6KvxGapnq6Vlrlw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nia-long-husband-4851541.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Everything To Know About Ime Udoka &amp;amp; Her Exes Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./all-about-adam-laroche-age-net-worth-relationship-career.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>All About Adam Laroche | Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eliza-butterworth-biography.html>Eliza Butterworth Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-mcclendon-mac-t-shirt.html>Chris McClendon MAC T-Shirt | Fan Arch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./franck-ribery.html>Franck Ribery Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-j-fox-wont-live-80-parkinsons-disease-video.html>Michael J.
