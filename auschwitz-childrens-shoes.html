It is sometimes referred to as Auschwitz II.</p><p>More than 1 million men, women, and children were murdered here. Six-year-old Steinberg’s unspeakable end began with his incarceration in the Theresienstadt Ghetto on Aug. 10, 1942. Steinberg’s father was separated from them and was transferred from Auschwitz to Dachau in 1944.</p><p>According to Hanna Kubike from the Auschwitz Museum Collections, Steinberg’s father lived to hear of his son’s death, as he was liberated from the Kaufering sub-camp.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-288735 alt="Documents Found In Auschwitz Shoes" width=900 height=507 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/documents-found-in-auschwitz-shoes.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-288735 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Memorial and Museum Auschwitz-Birkenau</span><span class=caption-body>Another shoe yielded numerous documents, which included the names Ackermann, Brávermann, and Beinhorn.</span></p><p>Along with Steinberg’s pair, another couple of shoes were found that contained documents written in Hungarian. Experts currently believe that these belonged to inmates who previously lived in Budapest as well as the city of Munkács in modern-day Ukraine.</p><p>“We already have shoes with such findings in our collections, but these are mainly newspapers, which were often used as insoles or additional insulation,” said Kubik. “This find is precious and interesting because the documents have been preserved in good condition and they contain dates, names of the persons concerned and handwritten captions. They date back to 1941 and 1942.”</p><p>Kubik explained that the papers include official documents, a piece of paper with a name, and part of a brochure. The documents included the names of Ackermann, Brávermann, and Beinhorn.</p><p>“They were probably deported to Auschwitz in the spring or summer of 1944 during the extermination of Hungarian Jews,” she said. “I hope that more in-depth research will allow us to determine the details of the individuals.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-288736 alt="Auschwitz Shoes Containing Documents" width=900 height=507 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/auschwitz-shoes-containing-documents.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-288736 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Memorial and Museum Auschwitz-Birkenau</span><span class=caption-body>All uncovered items are being prepared for further analysis by the Museum Collections department.</span></p><p>A great many items like this, which belonged to the myriad people killed in the concentration camp, are regularly on display.
