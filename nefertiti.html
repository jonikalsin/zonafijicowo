She also held unprecedented clout as a woman in Egyptian court.</p><p>But then in the 12th year of her husband’s 17-year rule, Nefertiti suddenly vanished from the historical record.</p><p>The disappearance of Queen Nefertiti has baffled historians for centuries, turning her life and legacy into an object of supreme fascination.</p><h2>Who Was Nefertiti?</h2><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-285533 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/relief-depicting-nefertiti.jpg alt="Relief Of Nefertiti" width=900 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-285533 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Met Museum</span><span class=caption-body>Nefertiti translates to “the beautiful one has come.”</span></p><p>While little is known about her origins, it is believed that Nefertiti was born around 1370 B.C. and was perhaps raised in the town of Akhmim where she was also the niece or daughter of an official named Ay.</p><p>Ay was a top advisor who eventually became pharaoh when King Tutankhamun later died in 1323 B.C. Other historians, however, posit that Nefertiti was actually a princess who hailed from the Mittani Kingdom in northern Syria. It was common for ancient Egyptians to favor one god over the other, and Nefertiti was said to favor the Egyptian sun god Aten.</p><p>Regardless of her origins, Nefertiti married Amenhotep IV, the son of Amenhotep III, when she was 15. Amenhotep III, otherwise known as Amenhotep the Magnificent, was the ninth pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty. Throughout this dynasty, Egyptians who favored the god of the Sun and air, Amun, had grown quite powerful and had garnered as much wealth and prestige as to challenge the power of the pharaoh by the time Amenhotep IV took the throne.</p><p>When he ascended to the throne in Thebes around 1353 B.C., Amenhotep IV and Nefertiti began to make great changes to Egyptian society. He discontinued the religious practices as they were in Egypt, closed the temples, and removed power from the cult of Amun in favor of his and Nefertiti’s preferred god, Aten.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-285532 alt="Akhenaten Sacrificing A Duck" width=800 height=640 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/akhenaten-sacrificing-a-duck.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-285532 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Met Museum</span><span class=caption-body>A relief shows Akhenaten sacrificing a duck, from circa 1353 B.C. The couple also had six daughters together, two of whom Akhenaten is said to have married and perhaps had children with.</span></p><p>Amenhotep IV made Aten the central focus of religious life and desecrated the names and imagery of Amun. He built a series of temples to Aten in the temple complex of Karnak near Luxor in his first year.</p><p>Egyptologist James Allen observed that Amenhotep even worked to change the plural “gods” to the singular “god.” Historians believe this change signified his desire to consolidate power under himself and Nefertiti alone.</p><p>Then, in the fifth year of his reign, Amenhotep IV <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">changed</a> his name to Akhenaten, which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">translates</a> to the “Living Spirit of Aten.”</p><p>Nefertiti added “Neferneferuaten” onto her name, which in full translated to “Beautiful are the beauties of Aten, a Beautiful Woman has come.”</p><p>The couple then moved the capitol northward, closer to the sun, in Amarna. They ruled with such unprecedented power that it’s even believed Nefertiti may have been a Pharaoh herself.</p><h2>She May Have Reigned As Pharaoh</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-285526 alt="Statue Of Akhenaten And Nefertiti" width=600 height=763 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/statue-of-akhenaten-and-nefertiti.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-285526 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Akhenaten and Nefertiti were depicted together with such frequency that many believe the two held equal power over Egypt.</span></p><p>The idealized imagery of earlier pharaohs was done away with. Depictions of Akhenaten included rather feminine hips and highly exaggerated features, while the imagery of Nefertiti slowly progressed into being virtually indistinguishable from Akhenaten.</p><p>This was a clear departure from her earlier imagery as a stereotypical young woman. Her final depictions during Akhenaten’s reign returned to a more realistic version, albeit far more regal than her pre-royal depictions, which suggested that she held equal power over Egypt.</p><p>The walls of temples and tombs constructed during Akhenaten’s rule showed Nefertiti alongside the pharaoh with such frequency that Egyptologists and historians believe they ruled side by side.

She was even explicitly depicted in numerous reliefs wearing the crown of a pharaoh.</p><p>After she gave birth to six daughters, Akhenaten took other wives — including his own sister, with whom he fathered King Tutankhamen. King Tut would eventually take Nefertiti’s third daughter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ankhesenamun</a>, as his wife.</p><p>But despite affecting such substantial changes in religious and cultural worship and potentially co-ruling Egypt, Nefertiti suddenly vanished.</p><h2>The Mysterious Death Of Queen Nefertiti</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-285530 alt="Akhenaten And Nefertiti Busts" width=900 height=506 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/akhenaten-and-nefertiti-busts.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-285530 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Neues Museum</span><span class=caption-body>The busts of Akhenaten and Nefertiti at the Neues Museum in Berlin.</span></p><p>After 12 years of presiding over Egypt with her husband, Queen Nefertiti disappeared from any and all depictions. To this day, no consensus among historians exists as to what became of her, though most scholars have concluded that she simply died.</p><p>A more tantalizing theory shared by other experts is that she fooled the public — and dressed herself as a man. This would have occurred after Akhenaten elevated her status from queen to co-regent, with equal power to the pharaoh, for which there is no clear evidence.</p><p>Another thesis proposes that Nefertiti was driven out of Egypt when worship of Amen-Ra was reintroduced following Akhenaten’s reign. Yet another set of scholars suggest that Nefertiti ruled as pharaoh by herself. These historians argue that it was Akhenaten who died, and that his successor Pharaoh Smenkhkare was actually Nefertiti in disguise.</p><p>Unfortunately, there’s a lack of primary evidence to support any of these assertions.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-285517 alt="Akhenaten With Nefertiti And Their Children" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/akhenaten-with-nefertiti-and-their-children.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-285517 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Some scholars believe that Akhenaten banished Nefertiti after she produced six daughters and no male heir.</span></p><p>If Akhenaten did die, it is possible that as the new pharaoh, Nefertiti reversed her husband’s religious policies. It is known that during Akhenaten’s reign, Nefertiti ordered a scribe to make divine offerings to Amun, desperately pleading for the god to return in was an attempt to control the upheaval caused by her husband’s religious conversion.</p><p>The notion that she disguised herself as a man, too, is not without precedent. Female pharaoh Hatshepsut ruled Egypt under such pretenses herself, during the 15th century B.C.; she even used a ceremonial false beard.</p><p>Lastly, some believe that Akhenaten had Nefertiti banished as she was incapable of producing a male heir and still others believe Nefertiti <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">committed</a> suicide when her daughter Mekitaten died during childbirth at age 13. None of these can be substantiated, either.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-285519 alt="Limestone With Nefertiti Carving" width=800 height=982 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/limestone-with-nefertiti-carving.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-285519 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>A limestone piece depicts Nefertiti’s head displayed at the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology in London.</span></p><p>But in 2015, Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves and archaeologist Mamdouh Eldamaty found what they believe to be a hidden doorway within Tutankhamoun’s tomb. Inside it contains structural anomalies that hint at a secret room which may hold the sarcophagus of Nefertiti.</p><h2>Nefertiti’s Tomb May Have Been Found</h2><p>In February 2020, a study <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">published in the journal Nature</a> detailed a promising ground-penetrating radar (GPR) survey around <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">King Tutankhamun’s tomb</a>. The findings lent credence to Reeves’s theory that the king’s burial palace <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">contained a larger, hidden tomb within</a>.</p><p>Egyptologist Ray Johnson of the University of Chicago’s Oriental Institute in Luxor, Egypt called Eldamaty’s ground-penetrating radar data “tremendously exciting.”</p><p>“Clearly there is something on the other side of the north wall of the burial chamber,” he said.</p>Zawi Hawass explores the KV35 tomb potentially hiding Nefertiti’s body.<p>While the potential for additional, hidden chambers beyond King Tut’s tomb has been debated among scholars for decades, some have dismissed the idea entirely while others have hired private companies to investigate. So far, nobody has either opened or entered the hidden room in question.</p><p>In addition to Eldamaty’s data, the fact that Nefertiti’s daughter was married to King Tut lends circumstantial credibility to the notion her body was placed in his burial palace.</p><p>As of now, however, what is left of Nefertiti are the ancient depictions, theories, and relics such as the revered limestone bust on display at Berlin’s Neues Museum. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovered</a> in 1912 by the German Oriental Company in Amarna — the capitol during Akhenaten’s reign — the bust was found in the workshop of an ancient Egyptian sculptor, Thutmose.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-285518 alt="Bust At Neues Museum" width=600 height=878 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nefertiti-bust-at-neues-museum.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-285518 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Some believe the bust of Nefertiti in Berlin is a fake or that the absence of her left iris meant that she suffered from an ophthalmic infection.

You cannot describe it with words. You must see it.”</p><p>The world’s response to the sculpture has since been as profound as Borchardt’s — it remains one of the most popular attractions at the museum in Berlin.</p><p>Not only is the sculpture world-famous, but the bust of Nefertiti is one of the most copied works from ancient Egypt.
