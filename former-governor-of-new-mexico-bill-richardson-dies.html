He was 75.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Richardson Center for Global Engagement, which he founded and led, said in a statement Saturday that he died in his sleep at his home in Chatham, Massachusetts.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“He lived his entire life in the service of others — including both his time in government and his subsequent career helping to free people held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad,” said Mickey Bergman, the center's vice president. "There was no person that Gov. Richardson would not speak with if it held the promise of returning a person to freedom. The world has lost a champion for those held unjustly abroad and I have lost a mentor and a dear friend.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Before his election in 2002 as governor, Richardson was the U.S. envoy to the United Nations and energy secretary under President Bill Clinton and served 14 years as a congressman representing northern New Mexico.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But he also forged an identity as an unofficial diplomatic troubleshooter. He traveled the globe negotiating the release of hostages and American servicemen from North Korea, Iraq, Cuba and Sudan and bargained with a who’s who of America’s adversaries, including Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. It was a role that Richardson relished, once describing himself as “the informal undersecretary for thugs.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I plead guilty to photo-ops and getting human beings rescued and improving the lives of human beings,” he once told reporters.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He helped secure the 2021 release of&nbsp;<a href=#>American journalist Danny Fenster</a>&nbsp;from a Myanmar prison and this year negotiated the freedom of&nbsp;<a href=#>Taylor Dudley</a>, who crossed the border from Poland into Russia. He flew to Moscow for a meeting with Russian government officials in the months before the release last year of&nbsp;<a href=#>Marine veteran Trevor Reed</a>&nbsp;in a prisoner swap and also worked on the cases of Brittney Griner, the WNBA star freed by Moscow last year, and Michael White, a Navy veteran freed by Iran in 2020.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Armed with a golden resume and wealth of experience in foreign and domestic affairs, Richardson ran for the 2008 Democratic nomination for president in hopes of becoming the nation’s first Hispanic president. He dropped out of the race after fourth place finishes in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Richardson was the nation’s only Hispanic governor during his two terms. He described being governor as “the best job I ever had.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It’s the most fun. You can get the most done. You set the agenda,” Richardson said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As governor, Richardson signed legislation in 2009 that repealed the death penalty. He called it the “most difficult decision in my political life” because he previously had supported capital punishment.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Other accomplishments as governor included $50,000-a-year minimum salaries for the most qualified teachers in New Mexico, an increase in the state minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.50 an hour, pre-kindergarten programs for 4-year-olds, renewable energy requirements for utilities and financing for large infrastructure projects, including a commercial spaceport in southern New Mexico and a $400 million commuter rail system.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M., called Richardson a “giant in public service and government.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“In his post-government career, he was trusted to handle some of the most sensitive diplomatic crises, and he did so with great success. Here in New Mexico, we will always remember him as our governor. He never stopped fighting for the state he called home,” Lujan said in a statement.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Some of his most prominent global work began in December 1994, when he was visiting North Korean nuclear sites and word came that an American helicopter pilot had been downed and his co-pilot killed.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Clinton White House enlisted Richardson’s help and, after days of tough negotiations, the then-congressman accompanied the remains of Chief Warrant Officer David Hilemon while paving the way for Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall to return home.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The following year, and after a personal appeal from Richardson, Saddam Hussein freed two Americans who had been imprisoned for four months, charged with illegally crossing into Iraq from Kuwait.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Richardson continued his freelance diplomacy even while serving as governor. He had barely started his first term as governor when he met with two North Korean envoys in Santa Fe. He traveled to North Korea in 2007 to recover remains of American servicemen killed in the Korean War.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 2006, he persuaded Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir to free Pulitzer Prize-winning American journalist Paul Salopek.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Richardson transformed the political landscape in New Mexico. He raised and spent record amounts on his campaigns. He brought Washington-style politics to an easygoing western state with a part-time Legislature.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, complained that Richardson threatened retribution against those who opposed him. Former Democratic state Sen. Tim Jennings of Roswell once said Richardson was “beating people over the head” in his dealings with lobbyists on a health care issue. Richardson dismissed criticisms of his administrative style.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Admittedly, I am aggressive. I use the bully pulpit of the governorship,” Richardson said. “But I don’t threaten retribution. They say I am a vindictive person. I just don’t believe that.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Longtime friends and supporters attributed Richardson’s success partly to his relentlessness. Bob Gallagher, who headed the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, said if Richardson wanted something done then “expect him to have a shotgun at the end of the hallway. Or a ramrod.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After dropping out of the 2008 presidential race, Richardson endorsed Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton. That happened despite a long-standing friendship with the Clintons.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Obama later nominated Richardson as secretary of commerce, but Richardson withdrew in early 2009 because of a federal investigation into an alleged pay-to-play scheme involving his administration in New Mexico.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Months later, the federal investigation ended with no charges against Richardson and his former top aides. Richardson had a troubled tenure as energy secretary because of a scandal over missing computer equipment with nuclear weapons secrets at Los Alamos National Laboratory and the government’s investigation and prosecution of former nuclear weapons scientist Wen Ho Lee.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Richardson approved Lee’s firing at Los Alamos in 1999. Lee spent nine months in solitary confinement, charged with 59 counts of mishandling sensitive information. Lee later pleaded guilty to one count of mishandling computer files and was released with the apology of a federal judge.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">William Blaine Richardson was born in Pasadena, California, but grew up in Mexico City with a Mexican mother and an American father who was a U.S. bank executive.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He attended prep school in Massachusetts and was a star baseball player. He later went to Tufts University and its graduate school in international relations, earning a master’s degree in international affairs.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Richardson moved to New Mexico in 1978 after working as a Capitol Hill staffer. He wanted to run for political office and said New Mexico, with its Hispanic roots, seemed like a good place. He campaigned for Congress just two years later — his only losing race.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 1982, he won a new congressional seat from northern New Mexico that the state picked up in reapportionment. He resigned from Congress in 1997 to join the Clinton administration as U.N. ambassador and became secretary of energy in 1998, holding the post until the end of the Clinton presidency.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZva2FlgXSBjp%2Bmq6WVp3qou9WeqaenomK8p3nNnq5mpZWttqS7jJugpaRdp7aktMCrm6ynnmKxqrHSaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./doug-flutie.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Doug Flutie</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-the-angels-listened-in-by-the-crests.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Meaning Behind The Song: The Angels Listened In by The Crests</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eliza-butterworth-biography.html>Eliza Butterworth Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-mcclendon-mac-t-shirt.html>Chris McClendon MAC T-Shirt | Fan Arch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./franck-ribery.html>Franck Ribery Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-j-fox-wont-live-80-parkinsons-disease-video.html>Michael J.
