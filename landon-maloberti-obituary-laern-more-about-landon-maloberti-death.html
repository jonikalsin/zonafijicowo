It was decided that the adoptive mother was to blame for the death of the boy, hence this action was taken as a result.</p><p>The allegations of severe child abuse that ultimately resulted in Landon Maloberti’s passing have reportedly prompted the authorities to investigate the two individuals in question. Both of them are suspected of having participated in the abusive behavior that finally resulted in Landon’s passing away. Landon sustained blunt force trauma to his head and neck, blunt force trauma to his body, and blunt force trauma to his limbs, as stated by Nicole Ziccarelli, who serves as the district attorney for Westmoreland County. In addition to that, she created the impression that Landon’s body had been injured as a result of blunt force trauma.</p><p>According to the federal complaint, after critically injuring Landon on January 29, Lauren and her husband, Jacob Maloberti, who works as a correctional officer at Fayette State Correctional Center, waited a whole day before driving him personally to the hospital. The fact that Jacob Maloberti works in the Fayette State Correctional Center does not change the reality that this is the situation. They mentioned that Lauren had informed them that Landon had been “wobbly from COVID a month prior. When the police arrived at the hospital, the staff informed them that Lauren did not exhibit any urgent symptoms, and that Lauren had told them that Landon was “wobbly from COVID.” Lauren also told the police that Landon was “wobbly from COVID.” After the police had left the hospital, the staff claimed that Lauren did not display any signs of urgency at any point throughout their shift with her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwuMCnm6imXaKurbvBnqmtoV2kr6rA1JqpsmWclrKzuoympqudXZavsMHTZqOappSku265wKWmm52iqbZusMSaq6Fn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mari-pepin-solis.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mari Pepin-Solis</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./auschwitz-childrens-shoes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Handwritten Note Found Inside Children's Shoes In Auschwitz</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eliza-butterworth-biography.html>Eliza Butterworth Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-mcclendon-mac-t-shirt.html>Chris McClendon MAC T-Shirt | Fan Arch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./franck-ribery.html>Franck Ribery Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-j-fox-wont-live-80-parkinsons-disease-video.html>Michael J.
