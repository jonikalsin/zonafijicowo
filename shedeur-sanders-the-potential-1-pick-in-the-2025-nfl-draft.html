Many believe Shedeur Sanders, a four-star quarterback from Colorado, has a chance to be taken first overall. In this case, we will take a closer look at the details and consequences of that potential breakout NFL star.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>The Rising Star</h2><p>While much of the talented crop (6-4, 220) prepared at Colorado has been noticed by NFL scouts, like Shedeur Sanders, son of Hall-of-Fame corner Deion. Yet among all of the adversity that has faced Colorado, Sanders' talent in particular has stood out this season as he is showing himself to be someone who could project comfortably at a QB1 level.<br data-mce-fragment=1>Redshirt junior Levonta Taylor is one of those and the NFL draft class of 2019 will also be headlined by elite talent like Nick Bosa, Ed Oliver, Rashan Gary, and Greg Little among others according to CBS Sports. Among those great numbers are a 69.3 percent creation ratio for the offense, passing for over 3200 yards, and leading all passers with his total of twenty-seven touchdowns have made him a top candidate to be selected #1 overall</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Evaluators' Perspectives</h2><p>There are a lot of NFL evaluators and talent scouts who have confidence in Sanders as well. So much so that there is a theory he would have been a first-round selection if were coming out in the 2024 draft. Littleton's thoughts also tell you everything about how much he is respected by serious scouts.<br data-mce-fragment=1>While some analysts, like Yahoo Sports' Nate Tice, have taken issue with how Sanders plays and other parts of his game., But it remains that Sanders has the traits and talents to do big things in this league.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Impact on the 2025 Draft</h2><p><br data-mce-fragment=1>The long-term effect Sanders could have on the league as a potential #1 pick in 2025 is something to monitor. Teams are gearing up for next season's draft and the opportunity to land a talent like Sanders has created nothing short of enthusiasm or even anticipation.<br data-mce-fragment=1>That ripple effect doesn't only apply to individual teams and will be part of the equation where Sanders' draft position is concerned. If that happens, it could change the entire quarterback market in the NFL and have teams lining up for a chance to bring Sanders' level of talent or potential on board.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>The Excitement Builds</h2><p><br data-mce-fragment=1>While the story around Sanders' ascension to No. 1 overall draft pick in '25 builds, so does intrigue for the coming draft five years from now. A three-sport star in high school, Sanders is the rare athleticism-meets-accuracy prospect who looks primed to play early and often at the next level.<br data-mce-fragment=1>But Shedeur Sanders is already generating some #1 pick talk for the 2025 draft, too. Pro Football Focus' lead draft analyst shared the news via Twitter on Thursday, and NFL fans as well as scouts are anxiously awaiting this next chapter in the story of a bright up-and-coming signal-caller.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>In the End</h2><p><br data-mce-fragment=1>In the end, finding an elite talent (and potential for many years to come) is what shows us Shedeur Sanders as a top 2025 NFL draft prospect. The football world at large would be on the edge of its collective seat awaiting that next draft and wild expectations for Sanders' status as a potential #1 overall pick. Now with his combination of abilities and a resounding impact on the field, it would seem Sanders is bound to make waves in the NFL leaving an indelible mark for years to come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0miaqKScmrSmecWopq2akaG5cL%2FHnpueraJiwKK6w56prGWknbJuvM6tnKesmZa5bn2MqaCco12eu27Ax55ka2hianqvsstmm6uZlqk%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-did-cm-punk-fight-in-the-ufc.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why did CM Punk Fight in the UFC?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jonathan-taylor-thomas.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jonathan Taylor Thomas Age, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Family &amp;amp; Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eliza-butterworth-biography.html>Eliza Butterworth Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-mcclendon-mac-t-shirt.html>Chris McClendon MAC T-Shirt | Fan Arch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./franck-ribery.html>Franck Ribery Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-j-fox-wont-live-80-parkinsons-disease-video.html>Michael J.
