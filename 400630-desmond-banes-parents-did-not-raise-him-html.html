However, they did not raise him, and despite this obstacle, Bane persevered and became a role model on and off the court.</p><p class=dh>Desmond Bane is a talented basketball player for the Memphis Grizzlies, known for his impressive work ethic and dedication to the game. However, he did not have an ordinary childhood, as he moved around a lot in his early years.</p><p class=dh>His parents left him in the care of his great-grandparents, and he never failed to appreciate them for their effort as they helped him make the right decisions.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Desmond Bane Stayed with His Great-Grandparents for Stability</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Desmond was born in 1998 when his mother was only a teenager. They <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://eu.indystar.com/story/sports/nba/2022/02/17/desmond-bane-takes-twisting-path-nba-but-he-there-now-memphis-grizzlies/6806666001/>moved twice</a> and lived with two of his aunts at different times before moving in with his great-uncle on a third move.</p><p class=dh>When his great-uncle's marriage did not work, he had to move around again. However, this time, his great-grandparents, Bob and Fabbie Bane, decided that he should <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://eu.pal-item.com/story/sports/high-school/2016/03/26/great-grandparents-molded-seton-catholic-star/81989968/>stay with them</a>.</p><p class=dh>They were a Christian family and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://theathletic.com/3251402/2022/04/15/desmond-bane-memphis-grizzlies-breakout/>raised him</a> in their faith. His grandparents then sent him off to Seton Catholic High School, and later he was off to Texas Christian University before joining the NBA. Not having to move around constantly helped him thrive.</p><p class=dh>Desmond's great-grandparents were protective of him and did not want him to be influenced by the lifestyle of other kids in their neighborhood. They gradually pushed him towards sports, and he could play almost everything.</p><p class=dh>When his great-uncle noticed that he loved watching the NBA games instead of playing video games like kids his age, he installed a regulation hoop for him outside Desmond's great-grandparents' home.</p><p class=dh>Even though the hoop was too high, he loved dunking. However, there were times he wanted them to lower the rim, but his great-grandfather would hide the crank, forcing him to play on a regular-sized goal.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Desmond Lost His Great-Grandparents</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Desmond's great-grandmother, Fabbie, was born Fabiola Erlinda Armijo in New Mexico on September 15, 1939. She came from a large family of ten children. She married on January 19, 1957, and became a homemaker and a self-taught seamstress after she retired.</p><p class=dh>Unfortunately, she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/pal-item/name/fabiola-bane-obituary?id=6734237">died</a> at 81 on February 9, 2021, at her home in Indiana. At the time of her death, she was survived by 12 grandchildren, 26 great-grandchildren, four sisters, two brothers, her sister-in-law, and many dear family and friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/a1c02b8b5159c77dbdaa7e0338f7bf5ef6b1ceeecd3ee0e8d3222918f64791a2.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Desmond Bane poses for a portrait for the Memphis Grizzlies on September 26, 2022, in Memphis | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Fabbie's family took to Facebook to thank and appreciate their family and friends as they announced her death, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.facebook.com/fabbie.bane/posts/pfbid0k1FHx3HeKq2tpkQYYARCRFAi5auSjvBFoMXw4FZspR8ABEKTo5quuE7vv7aXF2Zfl>writing</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Our family lost a wonderful mother, grandmother, great grandmother, aunt and friend today...our Fabulous Fabbie. On behalf of Bane Family we appreciate everyoneâ€™s condolences, prayers and support during our time of loss."</p><p class=dh>Due to the pandemic, the family revealed they would not hold any public services but would announce a later date for arrangements. They also thanked their family and friends for sending them prayers.</p><p class=dh>Before losing his great-grandmother, Desmond had lost his great-grandfather, Robert "Bob" Wayne Bane, at 87 on July 20, 2020. His great-grandfather was also born into a large family on September 10, 1932.</p><p class=dh>Bob was an electrician and facility manager and had retired from Wayne Corporation. Following <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/pal-item/name/robert-bane-obituary?id=8384886">his death</a>, his family celebrated his life as he and his wife were the pillars of strength to their family.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>What Is Desmond Bane's Relationship with His Parents?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Desmond's parents are Marissa Bane and Etieno Ekiko. Even though he lived with his great-grandparents, his mother is still a part of his life, while his father is not in the picture.</p><p class=dh>In 2016, an interview revealed that his mother lived in Indiana with his sisters. He would see his mother during the holidays but has never met his father.</p><p class=dh>When he was 13, he discovered that his father lived in Africa while the rest of his father's family were in Colorado. By 2022, he and his father were keeping in touch less frequently.</p><p class=dh>Now, judging by Marissa's Instagram page, she often sees her son. On her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/marissa_chantal1980/?hl=en">Instagram bio</a>, she even calls herself a #MemphisGrizzlyMom. She would post pictures of him and once <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/CjhDkCCukLc/?hl=en">referred</a> to him as her only boy in the caption of one of her posts.</p><p class=dh>Desmond, who plays alongside <a class="me a" href=#>Ja Morant</a> with the Memphis Grizzlies, has three sisters, and they have a good relationship. On January 1, 2023, his mother <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cm4raR6JuEa/>posted a picture</a> of all her children, as she called them her creation.</p><p class=dh>He would also make out time to hang out with his family. In April 2022, his mother <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CcG-Le2pT1-/>shared a picture</a> on Instagram of him hanging out with her and one of his younger sisters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1naW5jZXqlsdKmpqecXZeur7HSZqeaqpWjwbR5w6KbZqafqXqzrcisnGagmaJ7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kris-chellani-accident-linked-to-death-cause-where-is-his-father-dhruva-chellani.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kris Chellani Accident Linked To Death Cause: Where Is His Father Dhruva Chellani?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ryan-murphy-children-meet-logan-phineas-miller.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Ryan Murphy children: Meet Logan Phineas Miller</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eliza-butterworth-biography.html>Eliza Butterworth Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-mcclendon-mac-t-shirt.html>Chris McClendon MAC T-Shirt | Fan Arch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./franck-ribery.html>Franck Ribery Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-j-fox-wont-live-80-parkinsons-disease-video.html>Michael J.
