The following statement was made by Kandace Schipper’s family:</p><p>“We’re relieved to share that we’ve obtained our beloved daughter, sister and cousin Kandace Schipper’s location. Thank you to everyone who helped us spread the word. We’re grateful for every email, call, and share and are now focused on bringing her home safely.</p><p>After going through this process, we’re overwhelmed by the kindness of so many strangers. From Chicago to Tokyo, we were met with so much support and eagerness to help us find our loved one and have empathy for anyone seeking missing family members.</p><p>It’s a complicated process trying to find information and it wouldn’t have been possible for us without the generosity of so many.”</p><p>Kandace Schipper’s family members previously told Sara Machi that they hadn’t heard from her or her traveling companion in ten days. She’s always been a free spirit who enjoys exploring new places. Schipper’s sister, Chelse Rambo, stated-</p><p>“So when I heard she was traveling to Japan, I didn’t really think anything out of it.”</p><p>When Schipper’s family was wishing the youngest of her four sisters a happy birthday while the 29-year-old was touring Japan, Rambo had last heard from him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Kandace-Schipper-Found.webp><p>Schipper left for Japan on May 8 with almost daily updates on text and social media, but those stopped on June 4 and neither Schipper nor her traveling companion heard from her for several days.</p><p><strong>Rambo said:</strong></p><p>“We were unable to get in touch with him. I don’t know him all that well. Although we have made attempts to get in touch with his family, who are equally worried, we have not heard much.”</p><p>In Shinjuku City, a suburb of Tokyo, Schipper had just completed his last bank transaction at a burger joint. All of that led Schipper’s childhood acquaintance to file a Chicago Police complaint for a missing person.</p><p><strong>You can also take a look at below tweet:</strong></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Kandace Schipper: Chicago woman who went missing in Japan found safe <a href=# rel=noopener>#BreakingNew</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>#MissingPerson</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>#MissingPersonAlert</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/c328SXTFWH</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/oBU9DhGzbT</a></p><p>— Brett Murphy (@bmurphypointman) <a href=# rel=noopener>June 15, 2023</a></p><p><strong>Kendra Ensing said:</strong></p><p>“It was quite bizarre. I’ve never had to report someone missing to the police before, and I sincerely hope that no one ever has to because it’s a bad feeling.”</p><p>Family members didn’t go into detail about the events surrounding Schipper’s discovery. At the end of the month, she was expected to return to Chicago.</p><p>You must have also heard about the news of Nathan Kidd is missing. <strong>If he has been found yet or not?</strong> Find more details here:</p><p>If you want to check out more articles related to the missing person then you can join us on our <a href=# rel=noopener>Twitter account</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdga3xygY6cn6KbkZy8bsPOppinZZakwq%2BwjJqdrZ2iYrqqv9KipaBlmaN6q63PmqVo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bellamkonda-ganesh-babu-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bellamkonda Ganesh Babu Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./linda-yaccarino-wikipedia-bio-salary-age-and.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Linda Yaccarino Wikipedia Bio Salary Age And Ethnicity Explored</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eliza-butterworth-biography.html>Eliza Butterworth Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-mcclendon-mac-t-shirt.html>Chris McClendon MAC T-Shirt | Fan Arch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./franck-ribery.html>Franck Ribery Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-j-fox-wont-live-80-parkinsons-disease-video.html>Michael J.
