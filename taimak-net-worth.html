He is also known as a martial artist. His career has been active since 1985.</p><p>So, have you ever wondered how rich Taimak is, as of early 2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that the total size of Taimak’s net worth is over $400,000, accumulated through his successful involvement in the entertainment industry as a professional actor and martial artist. Another source of his net worth is coming from the sales of his autobiographical book – “Taimak, The Last Dragon” (2016).</p><h3>Taimak Net Worth $400,000</h3><p>Taimak was raised with his three siblings, spending his childhood in Los Angeles until the age of seven, when he moved with his family to Italy. The family friend was Federico Fellini, a famous film director, who took him on a tour of the set of “Roma”, where Taimak met Vincent Minnelli. This had a huge influence on his life, as he decided to become an actor. However, the family returned to New York, and he then began to train in martial arts.</p><p>Subsequently, Taimak’s acting career began when he was spotted by <a href=#>Berry Gordy</a>, and he started with an appearance in his film entitled “The Last Dragon” (1985) in the lead role of Leroy Green, which achieved enormous financial success. Since then, his career has only gone upwards, as well as his net worth. His next major role came five years later, when he appeared as Bob in the film “The White Girl”, which was followed by the role of Sean Halloway in “No More Dirty Deals” (1993), directed by David J. Schweitzer. During the decade, Taimak had small roles in several TV series such as “Red Shoe Diaries” (1996), “Malcolm & Eddie” (1998), and “Beverly Hills, 90210” (1999-2000). Beside that, he was also chosen to portray Sam in the 1999 film “Dreamers”.</p><p>He continued to line up successes, and his next appearance was in the film “Night Class” (2001), after which he starred in “They’re Just My Friends” (2006), “Book Of Swords” (2007), and “Fight The Panda Syndicate” (2008). To speak further about his acting career, Taimak appeared as Alexander Morton in a film entitled “Repeat Offenders: Jamais Vu” (2011), and most recently in the 2016 film “Enter The Fist And The Golden Fleece”. All of these roles added a considerable amount to his net worth.</p><p>Speaking about his career as a martial artist, Taimak won the New York State Kickboxing Competition when he was only 18 years old, after which he started studying Chinese Goju under Ron Van Clief, a martial arts legend. He also studied Taekwondo, Goju-Ryu, and Jujitsu, and in all of these he has black belts. Taimak became known for being a martial arts trainer to such celebrities as Madonna. Additionally, he released the fitness DVD “Taimak FIT (Find Inner Transformation)” and he currently works at his own gym called Fitness Concepts, increasing further his net worth.</p><p>When it comes to Taimak’s personal life, there is no information in the media about it, as he obviously keeps it to himself, although he is very active on social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, where he has a huge number of followers.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=5.7182130584192><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Taimak</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$400,000</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>June 27, 1964</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Los Angeles, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.8 m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nicknames</td><td>Taimak Guarriello , Taimak Guari</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0846818/</a></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Movies</td><td>The Last Dragon, The System Within, Book of Swords</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=8><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=9><td>1</td><td>Is trained in Jeet Kune Do, Tae Kwon Do, Wing Chun, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Hapkido, Goju-Ryu, & Chinese Goju.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2</td><td>Worked as a corner-man and an official in the early days of the The Ultimate Fighting Championship.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>3</td><td>Works as a martial arts trainer to the stars, including Madonna [2002]</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>4</td><td>Studied Chinese Goju under martial arts legend and fight choreographer Ron Van Clief.</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor readability=5><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Dreamers</td><td>1999/I</td><td></td><td>Sam</td></tr><tr><td>Malcolm & Eddie</td><td>1998</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Rick</td></tr><tr><td>Red Shoe Diaries</td><td>1996</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Zoner</td></tr><tr><td>WMAC Masters</td><td>1996</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Striking Eagle</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Kickback with Scott Pastore</td><td>1994</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Guest</td></tr><tr><td>No More Dirty Deals</td><td>1993</td><td></td><td>Sean Halloway</td></tr><tr><td>The White Girl</td><td>1990</td><td></td><td>Bob</td></tr><tr><td>A Different World</td><td>1989</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Garth Parks</td></tr><tr><td>The Last Dragon</td><td>1985</td><td></td><td>Leroy Green</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Enter the Fist and the Golden Fleece</td><td>2016</td><td></td><td>Dragon</td></tr><tr><td>Transporter</td><td>2013</td><td>Short</td><td>The Handler</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Tale of Timmy Two Chins</td><td>2013</td><td>Short</td><td>Coach</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Repeat Offenders: Jamais Vu</td><td>2011</td><td></td><td>Alexander Morton</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Fight the Panda Syndicate</td><td>2008</td><td></td><td>The Priest</td></tr><tr><td>Book of Swords</td><td>2007</td><td></td><td>Lucky</td></tr><tr><td>The System Within</td><td>2006</td><td></td><td>Pastor Ricky</td></tr><tr><td>They're Just My Friends</td><td>2006</td><td></td><td>Captain Taimak</td></tr><tr><td>Third Watch</td><td>2004</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Spider</td></tr><tr><td>Night Class</td><td>2001</td><td></td><td>Kick boxing instructor</td></tr><tr><td>Masquerade</td><td>2000</td><td>TV Movie</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Beverly Hills, 90210</td><td>1999-2000</td><td>TV Series</td><td>The Bartender / Barback</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Stunts <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=stunts readability=3><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>Madonna: Drowned World Tour 2001</td><td>2001</td><td>TV Movie documentary martial arts coordinator -
