And here we are sending prayers in our way, by looking back to the life that Lane left behind so soon.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Meet Lane Fernandez, Teen Mom Star Malorie Beaver’s Baby Daddy</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Lane Fernandez is survived by not only his son with his wife Kylee Rose Fernandez but also a daughter he shared with Teen Mom star Malorie Beaver.</p><p style=text-align:left>Despite the ongoing cold war between the exes, Malorie also shared her own tribute to the father of her baby daddy via her Instagram Story. “RIP”, she wrote alongside a heart emoji and adorable video of Lane with their daughter Emerson as a baby.</p><p style=text-align:left>As for Lane’s current wife Kylee, she seemed even more at loss with her baby daddy as well as her husband’s untimely passing. “I’m so lost without you babe.. I love you to the moon and back and I know you’re watching out for us”, she wrote in a Facebook post. In the heartbreaking message, she went on to promise that she will forever miss him and he has/will always be him, her rock and her best friend. Adding “It’s always been you💕 Nolyn, Emerson, and I love you so much and you were an amazing father, dog dad, and husband” she also mentioned Emerson, Malorie’s daughter who was born in 2018. Not to mention, Malorie had allegedly kept Lane and his wife Kylee from seeing Emerson.</p><p style=text-align:left>Last year, around July 2021, Malorie slammed Lane and Kylee, on Facebook. She had accused them of not being the loving parents they portray themselves to be. And following this, Lane, defending himself, had told The Sun that he tries and tries to see his daughter but cannot. At the time, he also stressed that he had not seen Emerson since Easter. Now-deceased Lane also had said that he was considering filing for joint custody, but because it required “a big money racket”, he was not already ready.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Lane Fernandez Cause Of Death</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Lane Fernandez’s cause of death was not disclosed as of now. Maybe the deceased’s family liked it that way.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Lane Fernandez Wife</strong></h3><p>Lane Fernandez and his wife Kylee welcomed their son Nolyn Lane into the world on 22 May 2022 and before that the couple got married on 21 November 2020. “Happy Mother’s Day to my Queen! Me and the dogs love you so much and are thankful for you every single day I can not wait to meet our baby boy 💕”, and this was the last time he wished his beautiful wife for being so amazing.</p><p>Kylee, as per her <a href=#>Facebook</a>, worked at Bulls Gap School, went to Cherokee High School (and left in 2018). She seemed to have always lived in her hometown of Rogersville, Tennessee and she had not yet posted on her Instagram <a href=#>@osbornekylee</a>.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>How Old Was Lane Fernandez At The Time Of His Death?</strong></h3><p>Lane Fernandez was 28 years old at the time of his death. He had likely turned the age in May of 2022.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Lane Fernandez Job</strong></h3><p>According to Lane’s Facebook, he started working as a technology integration specialist on 10 May 2022 and was likely attending the job until he died. And before that, he likely s<span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>tudied at Sequoyah High School.</span></p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Was Lane Fernandez On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Before Lane Fernandez passed away, his social media activity was only seen on Facebook (on the ‘Lane Fernandez’ account). There were some 1.7K friends who followed him here as of 14 June 2022.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Lane Fernandez Family</strong></h3><p>Lane Fernandez loved his parents and showed them every now and then on his social media. His father Rudy Fernandez, like him, celebrates his birthday in the month of May, on the 17th. While Lane’s mother, Jennifer Hernandez before she died used to celebrate hers on the 13th of July. Yes. Lane’s mother is also no longer alive.

Viewers saw his and his ex-girlfriend Malorie’s efforts to co-parent their little girl Emerson, and Lane’s wife Kylee was also in the picture.</p><p style=text-align:left>For instance, a July 2021 episode showed Malorie getting into a nasty online argument with Kylee after the couple posted a birthday tribute to Emerson. Rachel’s sister, who has also been part of the drama, had taken to Facebook to call out Lane and Kylee for portraying themselves as perfect parents. And situations as such always played out on the show. Apparently, the drama only had started after Kylee’s post.</p><p>Lane still did not have regular appearances on the show. He was there when he and Malorie tried to work on their relationship, and in other scenes. And Malorie’s, mother and sister were clearly against their attempted reconciliation at the time; because Malorie had accused Lane of abuse in the past.</p><p style=text-align:left></p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmpZmemnqnsdGnmKecla96uLTOZq6aq12irq270aKcZpqVlsOmvoybmJuxXZmupbDYaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./grandpa-kitchen.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Grandpa Kitchen - Bio, Age, Nationality, Net Worth, Facts, Career</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-j-coles-net-worth-in-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is J Cole's Net Worth in 2024?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eliza-butterworth-biography.html>Eliza Butterworth Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-mcclendon-mac-t-shirt.html>Chris McClendon MAC T-Shirt | Fan Arch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./franck-ribery.html>Franck Ribery Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-j-fox-wont-live-80-parkinsons-disease-video.html>Michael J.
