How much does Gates per second? Let's break down his earnings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marketrealist.com/data:image/webp;base64><p>Indian billionaire Gautam Adani has taken the spot as the world’s third-richest person, knocking Microsoft co-founder <a href=#>Bill Gates</a> down to No. 5 on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg Billionaires Index</a>. Rest assured, with a total net worth of about $117 billion, Gates isn’t hurting for cash. How much does Gates per second?</p><p>Last year, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a> estimated that Gates makes about $1,300 per second. At the time, his net worth was about $146 billion. Although his net worth has decreased a bit since then, Gates still makes more in a second than many people make in a day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Gates’ goal is to get off the list of the world’s wealthiest.</h2><p>Gates' drop in rank on the Billionaires list may actually be something he <a href=#>orchestrated</a>. In July, he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> that his goal was to give away all his wealth and eventually get off the list of the world’s wealthiest people.</p><p>“I have an obligation to return my resources to society in ways that have the greatest impact for reducing suffering and improving lives. And I hope others in positions of great wealth and privilege will step up in this moment too,” Gates tweeted on July 13.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Gates pledged to give much of his wealth to charity.</h2><p>Gates and his ex-wife Melinda launched the charitable organization, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, in 2000. The Gates Foundation is one of the world’s largest philanthropic organizations. In 2021, the Gate Foundation contributed $6.7 billion in charitable support. The Foundation plans to grow its spending to almost $9 billion by 2026.</p><p>In July, Gate donated about $20 billion to the Gates Foundation by transferring some of his shares in Canadian National Railway and Deere & Co. to the charitable organization, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a> reported.</p><p>Gates and fellow billionaire Warren Buffett also started The Giving Pledge in 2010, a campaign to encourage the extremely wealthy to share their wealth with philanthropic causes.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Gates’ wealth may have taken a hit in his divorce.</h2><p>Bill and Melinda Gates divorced in 2021 after 27 years of marriage. Although the financial details of their divorce weren’t made public, Gates’ <a href=#>net worth</a> at the time was $152 billion. If the couple split the wealth between them, they would have both walked away with about $76 billion, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a> reported.</p><p>Melinda is No. 164 on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with a net worth estimated at $11.1 billion. She has also <a href=#>pledged</a> to give much of her wealth away.</p><p>"I do believe that if you are lucky enough to be a billionaire, believe me, you can give away half of it and not change your life," Melinda told CBS Mornings anchor Gayle King in an interview earlier this year. "We should have a society where if for whatever reason wealth is in your hands, you, you put it back in society so that you change and you lift up others."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Gates isn’t leaving all his money to his kids.</h2><p>With both Bill and Melinda Gates committed to giving away much of their fortune to charity, there won’t be much left for their <a href=#>three children</a>: Jennifer, Rory, and Phoebe. Each will inherit only about $10 million of Gates money.</p><p>“It’s not a favor to kids to have them have huge sums of wealth. It distorts anything they might do, creating their own path,” Gates said in a 2017 interview.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae4psDRnpiloaOpe6S7zGiZoqScnryvrcirnKxnmKTEbrnUnJ9mnJ%2BawG6uyKWjZp%2BRqbK0ecyaop5loJq%2Fbr%2FEnKannF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jaden-edwards.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jaden Edwards</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./celine-tiffanie-ann-kids-obituary-mom-arrested-for-murder.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Celine Tiffanie Ann Kids Obituary: Mom Arrested For Murder</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eliza-butterworth-biography.html>Eliza Butterworth Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-mcclendon-mac-t-shirt.html>Chris McClendon MAC T-Shirt | Fan Arch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./franck-ribery.html>Franck Ribery Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-j-fox-wont-live-80-parkinsons-disease-video.html>Michael J.
