In January 2018 Gunplay’s ex-girlfriend, <strong>Aneka Johnston</strong> pressed charges against him&nbsp;for head-butting her outside The Office strip club.</p><p>Rapper Gunplay is not only known for his music, controversial tattoos but also for his acts of violence. It is not the first time that Gunplay has been pressed charges against. Well, back in 2012 he was sentenced to house arrest after he robbed his accountant at gunpoint. It was proved via video footage. He got away from a possible lifelong sentence as the case was eventually dismissed,</p><p>Whereas there is a different story going on with the fellow cast member of Gunplay. LHHM’s <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Trina is having a good time&nbsp;with her boyfriend, Raymond Taylor</a>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Gunplay_Assaulted_his_Ex-girlfriend_Aneka_Johnston></span>Gunplay Assaulted his Ex-girlfriend Aneka Johnston<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The unfortunate incident` took place on New Year’s day in Miami. As the “Bible on the Dash” rapper Gunplay was <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">attending The Office strip club</a> with his current girlfriend <strong>Keyara Stone,&nbsp;</strong>his ex-girlfriend happened to be performing there. After indulging in a verbal altercation regarding their past relationship, Gunplay left the club and later on waited in a parking lot for his former partner Aneka to come out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Aneka-Johnston-accuses-Gunplay-for-head-butting.jpg><p>Around 3 a.m. their heated conversation continued. During the dispute, Gunplay became irate and struck Aneka upon her face with his head. He hit her so hard that Gunplay’s ex-partner Aneka not only had bruises on her face and neck but her cornea was scratched as well. The poor girl then by herself drove herself to a nearby hospital for treatment.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>A post shared by Gunplay (@itzdonlogan)</a> on Jan 4, 2018 at 9:18am PST</p><p>To press criminal charges, she was referred to the Florida State Attorney’s Office&nbsp;by the police.

Johnston’s attorney&nbsp;<strong>Mark&nbsp;DiCowden </strong>told &nbsp;that Gunplay made a living out of crimes and glorifying harmful conduct on people. Mark further added that just because Gunplay is a celebrity, that doesn’t allow him to do whatever he likes.</p><p>We hope Rapper Gunplay would focus on his music career more rather than being involved in criminal activities.</p><p>For more&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>News</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Entertainment</a>&nbsp;follow&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>eCelebrityMirror</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeVo8GmvtOaoKellaPBcL7Aqaeeql2cwq%2B8y5qwrGWVrXqotdGlnauhlaOxbq3NnqKaZZqkta%2B%2F06ilZpuYlr%2BosdJo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./thomas-rhetts-life-changes-tour-is-coming-to-canada-in-2019.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Thomas Rhetts Life Changes Tour is Coming to Canada in 2019 Celeb Secrets Country</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./that-maid-is-on-something-nasty-fight-between-montana-hotel-worker-and-customer-goes-viral.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'That maid is on something': Nasty fight between Montana hotel worker and customer goes viral</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eliza-butterworth-biography.html>Eliza Butterworth Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-mcclendon-mac-t-shirt.html>Chris McClendon MAC T-Shirt | Fan Arch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./franck-ribery.html>Franck Ribery Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-j-fox-wont-live-80-parkinsons-disease-video.html>Michael J.
