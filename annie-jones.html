Annie entered the world of professionals at the age of eight as Gretl Von Trapp in The Sound of Music for Gordon Frost Organisation.</p><p>Here’s a picture of Annie with the prizes she won at Shine Vocal Competition 2019!</p><p>Since 2017, Annie has been taking vocal lessons from Dan Hamill Performance Coaching.

Howie has given her the title of a “beautiful little dance monkey” for her electrifying energy and sass. With such a powerful voice and personality, Annie might prove to be a tough competition for other singers on this season.
