Thus there is no information regarding his educational background. He became interested in comedy and acting in primary school, but his interest declined after attending some child acting classes.</p><p>Later, he became interested in music during his high school days. During that time, he took guitar lessons and later wrote his own music. Similarly, his musical influences and favorite bands are Metro Station, All Time Low, and Owl City. Also, he became the runner-up in his school’s Battle of the Bands.&nbsp; He even became a part of My Digital Escape with Kyle David Hall, BryanStars, Johnnie Guilbert, Alex Dorame, Jeydon Wale, and Shannon Taylor.</p><h2><span id=Professional_life>Professional life</span></h2><p>Professionally, Jordan Sweeto is a Canadian-Australian YouTube personality who is famous for his channel DanSweeto, which has gained over 2.26 million subscribers. He is a singer, video maker, animator, gamer, and actor who even contributed to the channels Our World Away and My Digital Escape. Sweeto also has two side channels for gaming and animation.</p><p>As a singer and musician, Sweeto has performed covers of songs by famous artists and even developed his music. He has worked in a band named “Dan Sweeto” as well as participated in his high school’s Battle of the Bands.</p><p>Later, he thought of taking his singing passion forward and formed a band after looking for members on YouTube with two musicians called Jamie and Brendan. Three of them and other some friends traveled across the country under the name “Dan Sweeto.” They began to attract decent fans following, which motivated them even more.</p><p>However, when the band was about to release their first single (“Forever to Me”), more than half the band left, leaving Dan Sweeto as a two-piece: Jordan and Brendan. But they didn’t leave their courage to work on passion and they released the song. They even started planning a tour. They got together some session musicians due to having only two members felt like something was missing for their second tour. One of the artists, Ben, remains friends with him to this day and often appears in YouTube videos and YouNow live shows with him.</p><p>Thus Ben rejoined the band, and they were now a three-piece. They named again themselves as “Sweeto.” After some months together, they were overtaken by a record label. They even traveled, appeared in magazines, and recorded with professionals. After a year, they felt as though life was pulling them apart and the band split up. And Sweeto decided to begin his solo career and started getting involved in different social media platforms.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-60349 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Jordan-Sweeto-CAREER.jpg alt="Jordan Sweeto" width=650 height=365 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-60349 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Jordan Sweeto on one of the YouTube videos (Source: YouTube)</p><h4>Solo career</h4><p>Then, Sweeto created his main channel on March 15, 2009.
