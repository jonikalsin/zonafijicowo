From an early age, Olivia was drawn to the performing arts, and aside from gymnastic lessons, Olivia also began honing her acting skills in local theater productions, but also in commercials for such products as Kidz Bop 14, Bratz Dolls, Hasbro, and others, so establishing her net worth.</p><p>She made her screen debut in 2009 with a minor role in the film “Black and Blue”, while two years later, she was chosen for the part of Kim Crawford in Disney’s TV series “Kickin’ It”. The role launched her to stardom, and from then on, Olivia’s career began a constant rise. In 2012 she was chosen for the lead role of Skylar Lewis in the television film “Girl Vs.

Monster”. In 2014 she signed a contract with Hollywood Records, and released her debut single two years later – “Phoenix”. The same year, Olivia also released her EP “Olivia”, which reached No. 19 on the US Top Heatseekers. In support of her release, Olivia embarked on a tour, joining Ryland Lynch, Forever in Your Mind, and Isaac Elliot, which also added to her net worth.</p><p>Most recently, Olivia collaborated with Brandon Beal on the song “Paradise”, and with MYBADD on the song “Party on a Weekday”, while she also released another single “Generous”.</p><p>Olivia has become a brand ambassador for Neutrogena, and has also partnered with mobile gaming system maker PlayMG, which also contributed to her wealth.</p><p>Regarding her personal life, Olivia dated Ray Kearin for two years, before breaking up with him in 2017.
