Here's a detailed account of his journey during his time with the Longhorns.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Early Years and Career Beginnings</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Case McCoy's career at the University of Texas began in 2010 when he enrolled as a January student. Unlike some of his notable predecessors, McCoy did not redshirt and made a brief appearance during his freshman year, rushing once for two yards and attempting one incomplete pass. Despite this limited playing time, McCoy's three years as a quarterback at Texas marked the tail end of Mack Brown's coaching era.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>College Performance and Challenges</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>McCoy's tenure as a quarterback was characterized by its highs and lows. He notably formed a strong connection with wide receiver Jaxon Shipley, although he never reached the same heights as his brother Colt McCoy, a legendary figure in Texas football history. Additionally, McCoy faced competition for the starting quarterback position, sharing playing time with David Ash and Garrett Gilbert during different seasons. While he had some standout moments, including a victory over Texas A&M in 2011 and an upset over Oklahoma in 2013, McCoy's career was marred by inconsistencies and injuries.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Career Stats and Achievements</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Throughout his college football career, McCoy amassed a total of 1,933 passing yards, 11 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions. His completion percentage stood at 56.8% with a passer rating of 109.3. Despite enduring challenges, McCoy displayed resilience, starting against formidable defenses and maintaining a winning record in more than half of his starts.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Legacy and Exit from the Program</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>As McCoy's college football journey came to an end, it became evident that he would be remembered for his durability and perseverance. While he may not have reached the same level of success as his brother Colt McCoy, Case McCoy's dedication to the Longhorns and his ability to overcome setbacks left an indelible mark on the program. As he bid farewell to the Texas football program, McCoy's departure marked the end of an era, both for himself and for the coaching career of Mack Brown.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Case McCoy's college football career was a tale of determination and resilience, with its fair share of challenges and triumphs. Despite not achieving the same level of success as some of his predecessors, McCoy's contributions to Texas Longhorn football are a testament to his unwavering commitment and perseverance in the face of adversity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn5qsXZ2usbzEp5ydZaSkerWx15qqZqSfo7Spu9GnZJ%2Bnn6mvorjLZqelmamav26vwKycZqWTmLy6</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./best-looking-nfl-players.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who are the Best-Looking NFL Players?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jason-mewes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jason Mewes- Net Worth, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Ethnicity, Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eliza-butterworth-biography.html>Eliza Butterworth Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-mcclendon-mac-t-shirt.html>Chris McClendon MAC T-Shirt | Fan Arch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./franck-ribery.html>Franck Ribery Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-j-fox-wont-live-80-parkinsons-disease-video.html>Michael J.
