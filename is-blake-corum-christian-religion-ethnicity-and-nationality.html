His ethnicity is diverse as he is biracial.</strong></p><p>The scouts have their eyes set on running back Blake Corum for a while now, with many projecting the young athlete to soon declare for the NFL draft.</p><p>Moreover, his talents come from his dad, who was also a footballer. Apart from football, Blake’s parents have also instilled values in him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Untitled-design-18.jpg><p>Blake Nolan Corum is a 23-year-old college-level football player. He is currently a senior and plays <a href=#>running back</a> for the Michigan Wolverines football team.</p><p>Corum completed his schooling in Baltimore, Maryland, and was the Baltimore Sun’s Offensive Player of the Year. Blake came out as Maryland’s finest and had his name as no. 12 best running back in 2020.</p><p>Eventually, Blake committed to the University of Michigan and was an instant star. He went on to break decade-old records set by famous players who later made it to the NFL.</p><p>In 2022, Corum won the Chicago Tribune Silver Football as the best player in the Big Ten. In addition, he was among the names in the unanimous All-American.</p><h2>Blake Corum Is A Christian</h2><p>Answering the primary concern regarding his religion, yes, the student-athlete is a Christian. He does not necessarily show or promote it but grew up with Christian values.</p><p>Furthermore, Blake attended Saint Frances Academy, which is a Catholic school.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Untitled-design-1-6-scaled.jpg><p>Blake is the type to uphold his religious values by giving back to society. During Thanksgiving, he organizes special donation events where he distributes food and other necessities.</p><p>Blake further explained, “I’ve been blessed my whole life, so I just want to bless others and see them smile.”</p><p>Likewise, he is also a regular churchgoer. Straight from his childhood, he followed God in a different way than others.</p><p>Moreover, the young running back has been like this since his childhood. His father, James Corum, said, “Blake always wanted to put some of the money that he earned in the church offering.”</p><h2>More On His Ethnicity And Nationality</h2><p>Talking about his ethnicity, Blake Corum is a biracial man; his father, James, is black, while his mother, Christin, is white.</p><p>So Blake and his siblings are a perfect mixture of two amazing cultures.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, he was born in Virginia and grew up in beautiful Baltimore, so Blake is a proud American man.</p><h2>Blake Is A Man With An Insane Work Ethic</h2><p>The 4-star recruit has already made his family glimmer with pride and excitement. His future looks even brighter as things stand.</p><p>His father, James Corum, who was a former athlete, trained him from a young age. But he far surpassed James’ expectations with his work ethic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Untitled-design-2-7.jpg><p>Even during his elementary school days, Blake used to perform 200 push-ups and sit-ups daily. In addition, he could easily match up with kids older than him in the gym.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>He further clarified</a>, &nbsp;“I’ve always had the hard work, and it’s never left me. I’m always trying to find a way to outdo someone.”</p><h3>Blake Corum Has Other Interests As Well</h3><p>Furthermore, Blake also has other interests apart from football.</p><p>Blake is particularly invested in becoming an entrepreneur, philanthropist, and sports broadcaster.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC10maZpZmbmnqku9GupGabmKe2tMDImqVmqpWhtqi1zqdknqyYo7aktdOyZJqmlGK7osDIqKWapJmpxnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mama-june-shannon-married-justin-stroud-second-time.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mama June Shannon Marries Justin Stroud For A Second Time And Reunites With All Four Daughters!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./warren-g-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Warren G's Net Worth (Updated 2024)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./eliza-butterworth-biography.html>Eliza Butterworth Bio (Wiki)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chris-mcclendon-mac-t-shirt.html>Chris McClendon MAC T-Shirt | Fan Arch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./franck-ribery.html>Franck Ribery Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./michael-j-fox-wont-live-80-parkinsons-disease-video.html>Michael J.
